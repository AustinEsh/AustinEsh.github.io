            About Me
                I am a computer software engineering student at Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology. During my time at TSCT,
                I have learned how to create small, interactive websites that are fully
                functional, and appealing to the eye.

        content
            I am a first-year computer software engineering student at Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology. Since I started 
            at TSCT, I have learned how to code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive websites that are nicely
            styled, and accessible on any device.

            I have also recently become an intern at Eagle Business Software. I have been studying how to code in C# for quite
            some time, and am now working on a simple C# practice project to prepare me for work at EBMS.

            Responsive Landing Page 10/30/2020
                This project was mainly to practice styling websites. The goal was to replicate a sample website, and make it
                responsive to the size of the window.
